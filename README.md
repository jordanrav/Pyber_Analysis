# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview

The purpose of this Analysis is to take in the information of how much each fare is in different types of cities (Rural, Urban and Suburban) and plotting a graph to make it easy to visualize which type of city has the highest fare.

## Results
based on the graphs below, Urban city types seem to be the most profitable city type out of the three types, 2nd place goes to Suburban and last place goes to Rural. this makes sense since the total amount of rides and total amount of divers in Urban city types is leading by a ton compared to the other city types.

## Summary
based on the information given, I have a couple recomendations for the ceo. the first recommendation I would recommend is to find more drivers for suburban type cities because it seems as if the suburban cities have more rides than there are drivers so it would be beneficial to find more drivers. the second recommendation I have is to focus less on rural cities, there is a significant drop off of riders in rural cities so I recommend putting less focus on any rural cities. finally I recommend that in Urban cities they raise the Fare Price because thats there biggest market when it comes to city size so raising their fare prices will astronomically increase their revenue gain.
